//! This crate provides approximate quantiles over data streams in a moderate
//! amount of memory.
//!
//! Order statistics is a rough business. Exact solutions are expensive in terms
//! of memory and computation. Recent literature has advanced approximations but
//! each have fundamental tradeoffs. This crate is intended to be a collection
//! of approximate algorithms that provide guarantees around space consumption.
